# Imaging and DAta Science library

Author: <b>Gabriele Valvano</b>

This library contains Python utilities for many Deep Learning applications. In addition to the most common Python libraries, the code requires the installation of TensorFlow.

You can include this package in your project running:
```  
git submodule add https://github.com/gvalvano/idas.git 
```  
  

This library has been developed during my research activities and it has to be intended as provisional and/or continuously updated.
